# Hardware requirements

    The absolute minimum requirements for the application are: 
    ðŸ’  200 MHz processor, 
    ðŸ’  32 MB of RAM, 
    ðŸ’  32 MB of storage.
    I think Nougat requires at least 512MB of RAM.
    ARMv5 or higher is needed to run native code without modifications.
    This is the build version of the CPU architecture from ARM.

# Software requirements
